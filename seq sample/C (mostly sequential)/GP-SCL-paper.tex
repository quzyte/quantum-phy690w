\begin{abstract} 

We present C programming language versions of earlier published 
Fortran programs (Muruganandam and Adhikari (2009) [1]) for calculating both stationary and non-stationary 
solutions of the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation. The GP 
equation describes the properties of dilute Bose-Einstein condensates at 
ultra-cold temperatures. C versions of programs use the same algorithms 
as the Fortran ones, involving real- and imaginary-time propagation 
based on a split-step Crank-Nicolson method. In a one-space-variable 
form of the GP equation, we consider the one-dimensional, 
two-dimensional, circularly-symmetric, and the three-dimensional 
spherically-symmetric harmonic-oscillator traps. In the 
two-space-variable form, we consider the GP equation in two-dimensional 
anisotropic and three-dimensional axially-symmetric traps. The 
fully-anisotropic three-dimensional GP equation is also considered.
In addition to these twelve programs, 
for six algorithms that involve two and three space variables, we have also 
developed threaded (OpenMP parallelized) programs, which allow 
numerical simulations to use all available CPU cores on a computer. All
18 programs are optimized and accompanied 
by makefiles for several popular C compilers. We 
present typical results for scalability of threaded codes and 
demonstrate almost linear speedup obtained with the new programs, 
allowing a decrease in execution times by an 
order of magnitude on modern multi-core computers.

{\em Journal reference of previous version:} Comput. Phys. Commun. 180 (2009) 1888.\\
{\em Does the new version supersede the previous version?:} No\\
{\em Nature of problem:} These programs are designed to solve the 
time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) nonlinear partial differential equation 
in one-, two- or three-space dimensions with a harmonic, 
circularly-symmetric, spherically-symmetric, axially-symmetric or fully 
anisotropic trap. The GP equation describes the properties 
of a dilute trapped Bose-Einstein condensate.\\
{\em Solution method:} The time-dependent GP equation is 
solved by the split-step Crank-Nicolson method by discretizing in space 
and time. The discretized equation is then solved by propagation, in 
either imaginary or real time, over small time steps. The method yields 
solutions of stationary and/or non-stationary problems.\\
{\em Reasons for the new version:} Previous Fortran programs [1] are 
used within the ultra-cold atoms [2-11] and nonlinear optics [12,13] 
communities, as well as in various other fields [14-16]. This new 
version represents translation of all programs to the C programming 
language, which will make it accessible to the wider parts of the 
corresponding communities. It is well known that numerical simulations of the GP equation in 
highly experimentally relevant geometries with two or three space 
variables are computationally very demanding, which presents an obstacle 
in detailed numerical studies of such systems. For this reason, we have 
developed threaded (OpenMP parallelized)
versions of programs imagtime2d, imagtime3d, 
imagtimeaxial, realtime2d, realtime3d, realtimeaxial, which are named 
imagtime2d-th, imagtime3d-th, imagtimeaxial-th, realtime2d-th, 
realtime3d-th, realtimeaxial-th, respectively. Figure 1 shows the 
scalability results obtained for OpenMP versions of programs realtime2d 
and realtime3d. As we can see, the speedup is almost linear, and on a 
computer with the total of 8 CPU cores we observe in Fig.~1(a) a
maximal speedup of around 7, 
or roughly 90\% of the ideal speedup, while 
on a computer with 12 CPU cores we find in Fig.~1(b) that 
the maximal speedup is around 9.6, or 80\% of the ideal speedup.
Such a speedup represents significant improvement in the performance.\\

{\em Summary of revisions:} All Fortran programs from the previous 
version [1] are translated to C and named in the same way. The structure 
of all programs is identical. We have introduced the use of 
comprehensive input files, where all parameters are explained in detail 
and can be set by a user. We have also included makefiles with tested 
and verified settings for GNU's gcc compiler, Intel's icc compiler, IBM's xlc compiler,
PGI's pgcc compiler, and Oracle's suncc (former Sun's) compiler. In addition to this, 6 new threaded (OpenMP 
parallelized) programs are supplied (imagtime2d-th, imagtime3d-th, 
imagtimeaxial-th, realtime2d-th, realtime3d-th, realtimeaxial-th) for 
algorithms involving two or three space variables. They are written by 
OpenMP-parallelizing the most computationally demanding loops in 
functions performing time evolution (calcnu, calclux, calcluy, calcluz), 
normalization (calcnorm), and calculation of physical quantities 
(calcmuen, calcrms). Since some of the dynamically allocated array 
variables are used within such loops, they had to be made private for 
each thread. This was done by allocating matrices instead of arrays, 
with the first index in all such matrices corresponding to a thread 
number.\\ 
{\em Additional comments:} This package consists of 18 programs, see 
“Program title” above, out of which 12 programs (i, ii, iv, v, vii, ix,

viii, xii, xv, xvii) are threaded (OpenMP parallelized). For the 
particular purpose of each program, please see descriptions below.\\
